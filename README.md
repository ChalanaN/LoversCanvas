# Lovers' Canvas ðŸ’ž
A place where lovers draw their future together.

This project was done for Valentine's Day during my free time. It allows anyone to interact with people and make relationships.
None of the users' data will be shared with others and they can communicate anything through the canvas.

This uses WebRTC under the hood for live communication.
